In Karachi nowadays we have a :deciduous_tree: plantation drive going on. A week ago we had a heat-wave where we hit **102+F the whole week** :sunny: It was seriously testing.

We are into the last 10 days of *Ramadaan* where we are encouraged to :pray: as much as possible, especially during the late night / early morning hours.
